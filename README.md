# datascience-capstoneproject1 - LIVER DISEASE PREDICTION DATASCIENSE /ML PROJECT 1
Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.  
Task 2: Create a predictive model with the implementation of  
different classifiers on the liver patient diseases dataset to predict liver diseases.
This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Target" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patients (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.
Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90".
Columns:
●	Age of the patient
●	Gender of the patient
●	Total Bilirubin
●	Direct Bilirubin
●	Alkaline Phosphotase
●	Alamine Aminotransferase
●	Aspartate Aminotransferase
●	Total Protiens
●	Albumin
●	Albumin and Globulin Ratio

●	Target: field used to split the data into two sets (1 : patient with  liver disease and 2: patient with no liver disease disease)
